> git push -u dev_ecommerce master :- Push the master branch to the new remote origin (dev_ecommerce) 
> git reset --hard 3a5698
> git push origin master --force : The --force option is used with the git push command to forcefully push the changes to the remote repository, overwriting the existing branch. This is necessary in situations where the commit history of the local branch has been modified (such as with git reset --hard), and you want to update the remote branch to reflect these changes.
