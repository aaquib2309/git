git fetch
> git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working    
  files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.
> It is safe because it doesn't update local directly. 
> git fetch origin master
> git merge origin master

git pull
> The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to 
  match that content.
> git pull origin master = git fetch + git merge
